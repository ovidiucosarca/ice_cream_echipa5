      <p class="description">Ice cream is a frozen dessert, typically made from milk or cream and flavoured with a
        sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit such as
        strawberries or peaches. It can also be made by whisking a flavored cream base and liquid nitrogen together.
        Food coloring is sometimes added, in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below the freezing point of
        water and stirred to incorporate air spaces and to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. The result is a
        smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes more malleable
        as its temperature increases.</p>
